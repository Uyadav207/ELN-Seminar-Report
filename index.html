        <p>
            Research data management (RDM) involves the organization, storage, and preservation of data generated during
            research. It ensures data integrity, accessibility, and compliance with ethical and legal standards.
            RDM includes data collection, documentation, sharing and long-term storage.
            Researchers use systematic strategies to manage data throughout their lifecycle, improving reproducibility
            and collaboration. Good RDM promotes transparency and facilitates validation of research results, promoting
            a structured approach to processing valuable information. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>

        </p>
        <p>
            According to Lass, the demand created by collaborative work is hindered by the functionality of paper
            notebooks. Sharing information recorded in a separate notebook requires the scientist to copy that
            information and send it to the requesting scientist. This takes time, effort and distracts the scientist
            from his main work. It also creates problems for scientists in receiving and using information. It is
            difficult to record and maintain an audit trail of the information contained in copied pages. <a
                href="#r2">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of the Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN), research data management (RDM) is seamlessly
            integrated.
            ELN provides a digital platform for scientists to record, organize and share their data and experimental
            results. RDM in ELN ensures systematic data processing throughout the research lifecycle, from data entry to
            sharing
            and archiving. ELN streamlines collaboration, improves reproducibility, and promotes efficient data
            organization.
            Researchers benefit from a unified platform that not only makes it easy to record experimental details, but
            also ensures data is properly managed, improving overall research efficiency and traceability origins of
            scientific work.

        <p>
            Poor UX design refers to design decisions and implementation that lead to a negative user experience. It may
            contain elements such as confusing navigation, poor visual hierarchy, long loading times,
            or difficult interactions. Poor UX design is usually unintended and can be due to a lack of awareness of
            user demands, lack of resources, or other issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dark patterns, on the other hand, are purposely created components or strategies that are used to deceive,
            manipulate, or exploit users. They are designed to persuade people to perform actions they
            may not wish to perform or to deceive them into disclosing sensitive information. Dark patterns are
            intentionally designed to favour the business or service provider over the user's best interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the key distinction between poor UX design and dark patterns is intent. Bad UX design is
            typically unintentional and results from design defects or shortcomings whereas dark patterns
            are purposefully created to deceive or manipulate users for the benefit of the business or service provider.

        <h2>4. Factors Affecting Choice of ELN. <span style="font-size: 12px;">[Written by Sindura Sivaprasad]</span>
        </h2>
        <h4>4.1 Sneaking</h4>
        <p>
            Sneaking refers to a category of dark pattern that tries to misrepresent user behavior or hide/delay
            information which users would likely object to if it were made available to them.
            <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            There are three types of the Sneaking dark pattern:
            Sneak into Basket, Hidden Costs, and Hidden Subscription
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.1.1 Sneak into basket</h5>
        The 'Sneak into Basket' is a type of dark pattern which adds additional products to users' shopping baskets
        without their approval, typically promoting the added products as
        'bonuses' and 'essential'. As shown in the figure 1 <a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="sneakIntoBasket.jpg" alt="sneak into basket" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Sneak into Basket on avasflowers.net. Despite the fact that no greeting cards
                are requested, one for $3.99 is automatically added.
                <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.1.2 Hidden Costs</h5>
        The 'Hidden Costs' dark pattern exposes users to new, additional, and unusually expensive charges immediately
        before they make a purchase.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="hidden costs.png" alt="hidden costs" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 2</strong>: Hidden Costs on proflowers.com. The Care & Handling fee ($2.99) is stated on
                the final step<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.1.3 Hidden Subscription</h5>
        The dark pattern 'Hidden Subscription' costs users a recurring subscription under the disguise of a one-time
        cost or a free trial. Users are often unaware of the recurring fee until they are charged several days
        or months after their purchase, if at all. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="hidden_Subscription.png" alt="Hidden subscription" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Hidden Subscription. The website fails to disclose that the Advantage service
                is an annual subscription worth $89
                unless the user clicks on Learn More <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>

        <h4>4.2 Urgency</h4>
        <p>
            The term 'urgency' refers to a type of dark pattern that imposes a time limit on a sale or deal, hence
            boosting up user decision-making and purchases. Urgency dark patterns take advantage of users' scarcity
            bias,
            making discounts and offers more appealing than they would otherwise be, and communicating that inaction
            will result in missing out on possible savings.

            There are two types of the Urgency dark pattern:
            Countdown Timers and Limited-time Messages <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.2.1 Countdown Timers</h5>
        The 'Countdown Timer' is a deceptive design that visually symbolizes a deadline by displaying a steadily
        decreasing time display until the deadline is reached. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="countdown_timers.png" alt="countdown timers" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 4</strong>:Countdown Timer on mattressfirm.com. The header displays a Flash Sale where
                the majority of
                discounted products remain the same on a day-to-day basis. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.2.2 Limited-Time Message</h5>
        The 'Limited-time Message' dark pattern is a static urgency message without a deadline. Websites conceal
        information from users and thereby mislead the nature
        of the offer by failing to state the deadline.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="Limited-Time message.png" alt="Limited-time Message" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 5</strong>: Limited-time Message on chicwish.com. The website
                claims the sale will end ‘soon’ without stating a deadline.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <h4>4.3 Misdirection</h4>
        <p>
            Dark patterns in the 'Misdirection' category employs visuals, language, and emotions to lead users in a
            particular direction or divert their attention from a specific option.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.

            There are four types of the Misdirection dark pattern:
            Confirmshaming, Trick Questions, Visual Interference and Pressured Selling <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.3.1 Confirmshaming</h5>
        The 'Confirmshaming' dark pattern employs language and emotion to discourage users from selecting a particular
        option. Confirmshaming was especially common in popup dialogs that requested
        users' email addresses in exchange for a discount, when the option to decline the offer—which the website did
        not want users to choose—was portrayed as a humiliating alternative. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="confirmshaming.jpeg" alt="Confirmshaming" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 6</strong>: Confirmshaming on radioshack.com.
                The option to dismiss the popup is framed
                to shame the user into avoiding it.
                <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.3.2 Visual Interference.</h5>
        The 'Visual Interference' dark pattern uses style and visual presentation to persuade users towards particular
        options while discouraging alternatives.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="visual_interference.png" alt=" Visual Interference" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 7</strong>: Visual Interference on greenfingers.com. The option to opt
                out of marketing communication is grayed, making it seem unavailable even though it can be clicked.<a
                    href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.3.3 Trick Questions.</h5>
        The 'Trick Questions' pattern uses deceptive or ambiguous terminology to trick users into opting for particular
        choices.
        Trick Questions takes advantage of the default and framing effect cognitive biases in users, making them more
        prone to a choice they mistakenly assume to be compatible with their
        preferences.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="trick_questions.png" alt="Trick Questions" />

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.3.4 Pressured Selling.</h5>
        The 'Pressured Selling' dark pattern describes defaults or high-pressure approaches that lead users to spend
        money on a more costly variant of a product or related products (cross-selling).<a href="#3">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="pressured selling.png" alt="Pressured Selling" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 9</strong>: Pressured Selling on
                1800flowers.com. The most
                expensive product is the default.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <h4>4.4 Social Proof</h4>
        <p>
            Individuals assess the correct action and behavior for themselves in a given scenario based on the action
            and behavior of others, according to the social proof principle. The 'Social Proof' dark pattern leverages
            this influence to speed up user decisions and purchases,
            taking use of the bandwagon effect cognitive bias.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.

            There are two types of the Social Proof dark pattern:
            Activity Notifications and Testimonials of Uncertain Origin.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.4.1 Activity Notifications</h5>
        The 'Activity Notification' dark pattern is a quick, frequently recurring, and attention-grabbing message
        appearing on product pages to highlight other users' activity.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>

                added the product to the cart in
                the last 72 hours. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>4.4.2 Testimonials of Uncertain Origin.</h5>
        The dark pattern 'Testimonials of Uncertain Origin' refers to the use of customer testimonials who's source or
        how they were collected and made is unclear.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="testimonials.png" alt="Testimonials" />

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <h4>4.5 Scarcity</h4>
        <p>
            Scarcity refers to the category of dark patterns that indicate a product's limited stock or great
            popularity, thereby enhancing its perceived worth and desirability.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>.

            There are two types of the Scarcity dark pattern: Low-stock Messages and High-demand Messages.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.5.1 Low-stock Messages</h5>
        The 'Low-stock Message' dark pattern notifies users when a product is in limited availability. <a
            href="#r2">[2]</a>
        <figure>
            <img src="low_stock.png" alt="Low-stock Messages" />

        <h4>4.6 Obstruction</h4>
        <p>
            Obstruction refers to the group of dark patterns that make a specific action more difficult than it should
            be in order to discourage users from performing that action. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.

            There is one type of the Obstruction dark pattern: Hard to Cancel
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>4.6.1 Hard to Cancel</h5>
        Obstruction makes it simple for people to sign up for recurring subscriptions and memberships, but also makes it
        difficult for them to cancel the subscriptions later. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>

        <p>
            Dark patterns are design decisions or strategies used in user interfaces to influence or trick users into
            performing behaviors they do not wish to perform. These patterns may vary among areas according to cultural
            values, legal regulations, and user expectations.

            Cultural and regional differences might influence how some design methods are seen and tolerated. What is
            accepted or manipulative in one culture or location may be considered unethical or deceitful in another.
            Specific colors, symbols, or phrases employed in dark patterns, for example, may have various implications
            or meanings in different cultures, resulting in differences in their effectiveness.

            Language also has an important function. Dark patterns rely largely on strong communication and
            comprehension between the user and the interface. To be effective, the wording, phrasing, or linguistic
            approaches utilized in dark patterns may need to be adjusted to other languages.
            In specific language circumstances, certain linguistic nuances or cultural references. may be used to create
            compelling or deceptive messaging.

        <h2>8. Empirical Experiment <span style="font-size: 12px;">[Written by Akshay Ghavale]</span> </h2>

        <p>
            In the paper titled "Towards the Identification of Dark Patterns: An Analysis Based on End-User Reactions"
            <a href="#r5">[5]</a> researchers aimed to investigate end-users' susceptibility to different types of dark
            patterns and
            understand
            the factors contributing to their victimization. The study was conducted in two phases: a self-administered
            questionnaire and an experiment. In the questionnaire phase, participants from the UX or IT industry were
            selected, along with users who had limited exposure to dark patterns. Five variables (frequency of
            occurrence, trustworthiness, level of frustration, misleading behavior, and physical appearance of the user
            interface) were identified as relevant for identifying dark patterns. The questionnaire included examples of
            each dark pattern, and participants rated the variables on a Likert scale. Correlations between the
            variables were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. The experiment phase involved 10 participants
            performing tasks related to Roach Motel and Forced Continuity dark patterns, followed by open-ended
            questions and variable rating. The results revealed participants' limited ability to identify dark patterns,
            with Forced Continuity being the most identified and Roach Motel the least identified. Significant
            correlations were found between the identification variables. However, no correlations were observed between
            the variables of the least and most identifiable dark patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the self-administered questionnaire phase, participants from the UX or IT industry were selected,
            including users with limited exposure to dark patterns. The questionnaire included examples of each dark
            pattern and assessed the variables of frequency of occurrence, trustworthiness, level of frustration,
            misleading behavior, and physical appearance of the user interface. Participants rated these variables on a
            Likert scale, and their responses were collected and analyzed using exploratory factor analysis.

            In the experiment phase, 10 participants, not belonging to the UX or IT industries, performed tasks related
            to Roach Motel and Forced Continuity dark patterns. The participants' actions, time taken to complete tasks,
            and willingness to provide personal information were observed. Open-ended questions were asked to gather
            participants' reactions and opinions on the tasks. Participants also rated the identification variables for
            each task.
        </p>

        <p>
            Analysis of the self-administered questionnaire phase revealed that most participants claimed to have never
            been tricked by websites, yet they were victims of at least one dark pattern. Forced Continuity was the most
            identified dark pattern, while Roach Motel was the least identified. Significant correlations were found
            between the identification variables, such as level of frustration and frequency of occurrence, frequency of
            occurrence and trustworthiness, and physical appearance and trustworthiness.

            In the experiment phase, participants struggled to locate the deactivation option on Facebook (Roach Motel),
            and the process took longer than expected (steps are shown in Figure 17). For the Forced Continuity task on
            Audible's website, participants
            found it unnecessary to provide credit card details but were still willing to proceed due to the brand's
            reputation (as shonwn in Figure 18). No significant correlations were found between the variables of the
            least and most identifiable
            dark patterns.

            This research highlights the limited ability of end-users to identify dark patterns, with significant
            variations in identification rates among different patterns. The identified variables, such as frequency of
            occurrence, trustworthiness, level of frustration, misleading behavior, and physical appearance, play
            crucial roles in the identification process. The findings emphasize the need for increased awareness,
            improved user interfaces, and effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact of dark patterns on
            end-users. Further research can focus on developing strategies to enhance user awareness and empower
            individuals to recognize and resist dark patterns.

        <h2>9. Conclusion <span style="font-size: 12px;">[Written by Akshay Ghavale]</span> </h2>
        <p>
            To summarize, dark patterns are deceptive design strategies intended to manipulate and influence online user
            behavior. They are meticulously designed to exploit psychological biases and nudge people into activities
            they may not have meant or desired. Dark patterns can be found on e-commerce websites, social media
            platforms, and mobile applications. Dark patterns are troubling because they can have unexpected
            implications such as privacy violations, higher spending, and decreased user liberty. Companies can push
            users towards choices that serve their own interests, frequently at the expense of the users' best

            Understanding and acknowledging dark patterns is essential for users to make educated online decisions and
            maintain their rights. Companies and authorities must follow ethical design principles in order to encourage
            transparency and accountability in user experiences. We can build a digital environment that respects users'
            autonomy and supports their well-being by encouraging user empowerment, informed consent, and true choice.
            Combating dark patterns, in the end, requires a collaborative effort from users, designers, and legislators.
            Users should remain watchful, learn about popular dark pattern methods, and report cases of deceptive
            design. Designers and businesses must prioritize user trust and ethical standards, ensuring that their
            design choices are in line with user demands and preferences. Regulators can play an important role in
            creating rules and enforcing regulations that promote fair and transparent design processes, holding those
            who use deceptive strategies accountable. We can work toward a digital ecosystem that respects user freedom,
            encourages trust, and empowers individuals to make informed digital choices by raising awareness, supporting
            ethical design, and enforcing relevant laws.
