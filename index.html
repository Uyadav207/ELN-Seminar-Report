        <p>
            According to Lass, the demand created by collaborative work is hindered by the functionality of paper
            notebooks. Sharing information recorded in a separate notebook requires the scientist to copy that
            information and send it to the requesting scientist. This takes time, effort and distracts the scientist
            from his main work. It also creates problems for scientists in receiving and using information. It is
            difficult to record and maintain an audit trail of the information contained in copied pages. <a
                href="#r2">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of the Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN), research data management (RDM) is seamlessly
            integrated.
            ELN provides a digital platform for scientists to record, organize and share their data and experimental
            results. RDM in ELN ensures systematic data processing throughout the research lifecycle, from data entry to
            sharing
            and archiving. ELN streamlines collaboration, improves reproducibility, and promotes efficient data
            organization.
            Researchers benefit from a unified platform that not only makes it easy to record experimental details, but
            also ensures data is properly managed, improving overall research efficiency and traceability origins of
